in the cart.py module i hav forgotten to provide request parameter apart from self
please correct it
the invalid literal for int could only mean that at home the db.sqllite or the backend didnt have any values so the <?P product_id+0/>
or something like this did get a string but it didnt have any integers or id in it.
this thread is what i think is my problem
